# React Template
### a personalized template built on top of create-react-app that has my standard dependencies and setup all ready to go
includes react router, webpack, babel, and sass

to use:
- clone into a new folder with `git clone https://github.com/avelaga/react-template.git <folder-name>`
- remove origin with  `git remote remove origin`
- create a new github repo
- connect new repo with `git remote add origin <repo-link>`
- push and finished setup to new repo with `git push -u origin master`

use `npm run dev` to start the webpack dev server and `npm run build` to build the production files and save them in /dist

now you're good to go and use it as a new project
